# PWA Icons Required

You need to create three icon files for the PWA to work properly on iOS:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels  
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixels

Place these files in this directory (`web/public/`).

You can:
- Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Use online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Create simple colored squares with text as placeholders

The icons should be square PNG images with your app logo or a simple design.
