# PWA Icon Setup

## Simple Setup - One Icon File

Just create **ONE** icon file:

1. **Create `icon.png`** in the `web/public/` directory
   - Size: **512x512 pixels** (or larger, square)
   - Format: PNG
   - The app will use this same file for all icon sizes

2. **That's it!** The PWA will automatically use this icon for:
   - App icons (192x192, 512x512)
   - iOS home screen icon (180x180)
   - All other PWA icon sizes

## How to Create the Icon

You can:
- Use ChatGPT/DALL-E to generate an icon (ask for "512x512 PNG app icon for meal tracking app")
- Use any image editor
- Use online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Create a simple square image with your design

The icon should be square and work well at small sizes. A simple design with fork/knife or "K" letter works great!
